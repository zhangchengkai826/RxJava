## Step 1 - Learn about RxJava and write the Introduction part
### A preliminary understanding of the basic functions and basic usage of RxJava
* RxJava – Reactive Extensions for the JVM – a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java VM. ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
* It extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data and/or events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.

## Step 1. Read the official document and learn about RxJava

(Below are some learning notes)
RxJava is a extension of ReactiveX based on Java:
- Extended observer mode
- Support data\event sequence
- Provide operators to group sequences together in a declarative manner
- Internal processing of threads, synchronization, thread safety and concurrent data structures
    ReactiveX provides **responsive programming for a variety of programming languages** (observer mode, Iterator mode, functional mode)
	Responsive programming: A scenario in which a program reacts when data appears (based on events)
	Functional programming: building software with pure functionality

Key components:
	**observables**: Can send zero or more data and control speed
	**observer**: Observe the observable, react to the outgoing data, process the data

## Step 2. Learn How to Use RxJava

## Step 3. Read the Source Code
	Reading the source directly is difficult, so I just read some blogs to get started. And the schedule is kind of slow.
## Step 4. Write the Evolution Perspective
	The evolution of RxJava are behind the source code with some documents. Without finishing the source code, I read some significant  documents to summarize the evolution. It must has some problems, but it helps me main development of RxJava. And I will revise with my reading.

# Task1 Read the official document
### Reference
* [RxJava official doc](https://mcxiaoke.gitbooks.io/rxdocs/content/)
## what have I got?
* **The understanding of Rx**
>Given the definition of Microsoft, Rx is a function library, which developers can make use of an observed sequence and style of LINQ query operators to writing asynchronous and based on the program of events, use the Rx, developers can use the Observables said asynchronous data flow, use LINQ query operators asynchronous data stream, with Schedulers parameterized asynchronous concurrent processing of data flow, Rx can define like this: Rx = LINQ Observables + + Schedulers.
ReactiveX. IO defines Rx as a programming interface for asynchronous programming using observable data streams, and ReactiveX combines the essence of observer mode, iterator mode, and functional programming.

* **The environment of RxJava**  
It can adapt to plenties of laguages, as long as you are a kind of JVM language. so it has to work at an environment which has installed JDK and JVM. It's very easy to use this library. What you have to do is just download this library from the Internet and then you can use it.  
It uses github to do the version control. All the code is open source. you can give your suggestions or do some changes yourself through this and the official web. 

* **The basic use of RxJava**  
We still make use of the idea of the object. In this library, we mainly have two roles: observable, observer. And we use subject to combine these two object together to make them interactive.  We also have a concept named event.
Usually, we use create() to new a observable object. Its source code are as follows: 
 
<pre>
@CheckReturnValue       
@SchedulerSupport(SchedulerSupport.None)    
public static <T> Observable<T> create(ObservableOnSubscribe<T> source){  
	ObjectHelper.requireNonNull(source, message:"source is null");  
	return RxJavaPlugins.onAssembly(new ObservableCreate<T>(source));  
}
</pre>  

When we use create method, we use T as the parameter that when we need to transform an event we use.
Also, in the following method, such as the method in the interface ObservableOnSubscribe, we found that observable is inherited from Emitter.  And in it, we have seen the method:onNext, onCompleted and other familiar methods.   
I guess the fact is that when emitter call the event onNext, it will call its observer's onNext event. In this way, it can finish its process of one aspect send an event and the other aspect deal with this event.

* **The main user of RxJava**
* **The aim of RxJava**  
It aims to make it easier for us to deal with the problems of asynchronize. It have many advantages including simple, convenient. It makes the whole process like a pipeline.
# Task2 Write the Abstract and the Context View part of the project report
### The specific details can be seen in our project report.
# Task3 Try to understand the source code  
I mainly use this two links to help me study the source code of RxJava:
